        Dramatic weight loss carries many benefits for people who have had bariatric weight reduction surgery or otherwise 
        lost substantial amounts of weight. For these men and women, the skin and tissues often lack the elasticity to 
        conform to the new, reduced size of their body.

        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Body Contouring Following Major Weight Loss removes excess sagging fat and skin while improving the shape and tone of 
          the underlying support tissue. The result is a more normal appearance with smoother contours. The results are generally 
          long-lasting if you maintain your weight and a good level of fitness.
       </p>

</p>

<h3>Body Contouring Procedure</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Body contouring are surgical procedures and may require extensive incisions. Incision length and pattern depend 
  on the amount and location of excess skin to be removed as well as surgical judgment. Advanced techniques usually allow incisions to be placed in strategic locations where they can be hidden by most types of clothing and swimsuits.
</p>
<h5 className='fw-bold'>Anesthesia</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The choices for anesthesia administered during your buttock lift procedure include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. 
  Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.
</p>
<h4 className='fw-bold'>Body Contouring After Major Weight Loss Incisions</h4>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  All body contouring procedures require large incisions to remove excess skin. In many cases, these incisions may be extensive.<br/>

  Incision length and pattern depend on the amount and location of excess skin to be removed as well as personal preference and 
  your doctor's surgical judgment. Advanced techniques usually allow incisions to be placed in strategic locations where they 
  can be hidden by most types of clothing, but this is not always the case.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Body contouring is often performed in stages. Your condition and goals, as well as your plastic surgeon's best judgment, will influence how your surgical plan is defined.
</p>
<h5 className='fw-bold'>Closing the Incisions</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Deep sutures within underlying tissues help to form and support the newly shaped contours. 
  Sutures, skin adhesives, tapes or clips may be used to close the skin incisions.
</p>   
<h5 className='fw-bold'>See the Result</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The results of a gluteal lift are visible almost immediately. However, the tissues will need to settle within the first 
  3 to 6 months and the incision lines can take up to 2 years to mature.
</p>   

<h3>Buttocks Lift Recovery</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  After your butt lift procedure, dressings/bandages will be applied to the incisions. Small, thin tubes may 
  be temporarily placed under the skin to drain any excess blood or fluid that may collect. 
  You will be taken into a recovery area to be closely monitored and may be permitted to go home after a few hours.
</p>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  You will be instructed to wear a support garment around-the-clock following your surgery. 
  Your surgeon will tell you how long you need to wear the garment and if there are any 
  other garments you may have to wear during your recovery.
  </p>
  <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  It's important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, motion, swelling or abrasion during 
  the time of healing.
  </p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself post-op. Following your physician's 
  instructions is essential to the success of your surgery. These instructions may include:
  </p>
  <ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>How to care for your surgical site(s) following surgery.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing.</li>
   <li>Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site or in your general health.</li>
   <li>How to care for your drains.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
  </ul>
