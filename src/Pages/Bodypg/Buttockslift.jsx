        Aging, sun damage, pregnancy, significant weight fluctuations and genetic factors can all contribute to 
        poor tissue elasticity, resulting in sagging of the buttocks. A Buttock Lift, or Gluteal Lift, is the 
        surgical removal of skin and fat in the buttocks area to improve the shape and tone of the underlying tissue .
        </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Buttock lifts remove excess sagging skin and fat to achieve a smoother and more pleasing contour. 
            A traditional gluteal lift will not make your rear end larger, but may improve a dimpled, 
            irregular skin surface. This procedure may be included in a Lower Body Lift or may be performed separately.
            </p>

<h3>Preparing for an Buttocks Lift</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  In preparing for buttocks lift surgery, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Buttocks lifts are performed at our accredited Outpatient Surgery Facility.
  Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
</p>

<h3>Buttocks Lift Procedure</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Buttock lifts are surgical procedures and may require extensive incisions. Incision length and pattern depend 
  on the amount and location of excess skin to be removed as well as surgical judgment. Advanced techniques usually allow incisions to be placed in strategic locations where they can be hidden by most types of clothing and swimsuits.
</p>
<h4 className='fw-bold'>Anesthesia</h4>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The choices for anesthesia administered during your buttock lift procedure include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. 
  Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.
</p>
<h5 className='fw-bold'>The Incision</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  One common technique of gluteal lift uses an incision just below the waist line and is commonly combined with an abdominoplasty 
  incision in a body contouring procedure. Liposuction may be used for improved contouring as well. 
  Some of the tissue that is normally removed may be strategically left in place, hidden underneath 
  the remaining skin.<br/>

  Another technique uses an incision just below the buttocks and is placed in the crease between the buttocks 
  and the upper thigh. The excess skin and tissues are removed resulting in a more defined crease and 
  sometimes smooths the skin of the back of the upper leg.
</p>
<h4 className='fw-bold'>Closing the Incisions</h4>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Deep sutures within underlying tissues help to form and support the newly shaped contours. 
  Sutures, skin adhesives, tapes or clips may be used to close the skin incisions.
</p>   
<h4 className='fw-bold'>See the Result</h4>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The results of a gluteal lift are visible almost immediately. However, the tissues will need to settle within the first 
  3 to 6 months and the incision lines can take up to 2 years to mature.
</p>   

<h3>Buttocks Lift Recovery</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  After your butt lift procedure, dressings/bandages will be applied to the incisions. Small, thin tubes may 
  be temporarily placed under the skin to drain any excess blood or fluid that may collect. 
  You will be taken into a recovery area to be closely monitored and may be permitted to go home after a few hours.
</p>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  You will be instructed to wear a support garment around-the-clock following your surgery. 
  Your surgeon will tell you how long you need to wear the garment and if there are any 
  other garments you may have to wear during your recovery.
  </p>
  <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  It's important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, motion, swelling or abrasion during 
  the time of healing.
  </p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself post-op. Following your physician's 
  instructions is essential to the success of your surgery. These instructions may include:
  </p>
  <ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>How to care for your surgical site(s) following surgery.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing.</li>
   <li>Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site or in your general health.</li>
   <li>How to care for your drains.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
  </ul>
