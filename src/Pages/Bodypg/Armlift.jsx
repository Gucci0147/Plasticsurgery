        Fluctuations in weight, growing older and heredity can cause your upper arms to take on a drooping, sagging appearance. 
        This condition cannot be corrected through exercise.
        </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            An Arm Lift, or Brachioplasty, reshapes the underside portion of the upper arm from the underarm to the elbow. 
            Arm Lifts are performed to reduce sagging skin, tighten and smooth the underlying supportive tissue that defines 
            the upper arm shape, and reduce localized pockets of fat.
            </p>
        <h3>Arm Lift candidates</h3>
        <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
          In general, candidates for an arm lift include:
        </p>
        <ul className='fs-5'>
          <li>Adults with significant upper arm skin laxity.</li>
          <li>Adults of any age whose weight is relatively stable and who are not significantly overweight.</li>
          <li>Healthy people without medical conditions that impair healing or increase surgical risks.</li>
          <li>Non-smokers with a positive outlook and realistic expectations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Arm Lift Consultation</h3>
        <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
          During your arm lift consultation, be prepared to discuss:
        </p>
    <ul className='fs-5'>
      <li>Your surgical goals.</li>
      <li>Medical conditions, drug allergies and medical treatments.</li>
      <li>Use of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</li>
      <li>Previous surgeries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
      Your arm lift surgeon will also:
    </p>
    <ul className='fs-5'>
        <li>Evaluate your general health and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors.</li>
        <li>Take photographs.</li>
        <li>Discuss your options.</li>
        <li>Discuss the likely outcomes of arm lift surgery and any risks or potential complications.</li>
    </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Be sure to ask questions at your consultation. It is very important to understand all aspects of your arm lift. 
  It's natural to feel some anxiety, whether preoperative stress or excitement about your anticipated new look. 
  Don't be shy about discussing these feelings with your plastic surgeon.</p>
 
  <h3>Arm Lift Risks and Safety Information</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The decision to have arm lift surgery is extremely personal. You will have to decide if the benefits, 
  risks and potential complications of an arm lift are acceptable.
  </p>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The risks of an arm lift include:
  </p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Anesthesia risks.</li>
    <li>Bleeding.</li>
    <li>Infection.</li>
    <li>Poor wound healing.</li>
    <li>Unsightly scarring.</li>
    <li>Fluid accumulation (seroma).</li>
    <li>Damage to deeper structures such as nerves, blood vessels and muscles.</li>
    <li>Fatty tissue under the skin might die (fat necrosis).</li>
    <li>Numbness or other changes in skin sensation.</li>
    <li>Pain, which may persist.</li>
    <li>Sutures may not absorb, but spontaneously surface through the skin, causing irritation, drainage and redness.</li>
    <li>Possible need for revisional surgery.</li>
    </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  These risks and others will be fully discussed prior to your consent. It is important that you address all of your 
  questions directly with your plastic surgeon. You will be asked to sign consent forms to ensure that you 
  fully understand the procedure.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for an Arm Lift</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  In preparing for arm lift surgery, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Arm lifts are performed at our accredited Outpatient Surgery Facility in Birmingham, Alabama. 
  Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
</p>

<h3>Arm Lift Procedure</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Anesthesia choices for arm lift surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. Your doctor 
  will recommend the best choice for you.
</p>
<h5  className='fw-bold'>Arm Lift Incisions</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Incision length and pattern during arm lift surgery depend on the amount and location of excess skin 
  to be removed as well as the best judgment of your plastic surgeon.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Incisions are generally placed on the inside of the arm or on the back of the arm, depending on the surgeon's preference, and may extend from the underarm (axilla) to just above the elbow. Excess fat may be directly excised or treated with Liposuction.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Depending on your specific condition, incisions may be more limited. Then, underlying supportive tissue is 
  tightened and reshaped with internal sutures. Finally, the skin is smoothed over the new contour of your arm.
</p>   
<ul className='fs-5'>
  <li>Inner arm incisions</li>
  <li>Back of arm incisions</li>
  <li>Minimal incision</li>
</ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your incisions will be closed with absorbable sutures or stitches that will be removed within 1 to 2 weeks.
</p>

<h3>Arm Lift Recovery</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your physician's 
  instructions is essential to the success of your arm lift and recovery. These instructions may include:
</p>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  How to care for the surgical site and drains.
  </p>
  <ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing.</li>
   <li>Specific concerns to look for.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
  </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Following your arm lift, dressings or bandages may be applied to your incisions and your arms may be wrapped in 
  an elastic bandage or compression garment to minimize swelling. A small, thin tube may be temporarily placed under 
  the skin to drain any excess blood or fluids.
</p>
  <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
    It's important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, swelling, abrasion or motion 
    during the time of healing.
