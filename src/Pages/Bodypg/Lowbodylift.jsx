<h3>Preparing for an Body Lift</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  In preparing for body lift surgery, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Lower body lifts are performed at our accredited Outpatient Surgery Facility.
  Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
</p>

<h3>Body Lift Procedure</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Anesthesia choices for lower body lift surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. 
  Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.
</p>
<h5 className='fw-bold'>Body Lift Incisions</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Lower body lifts are surgical procedures and require extensive incisions. Incision length and pattern 
  depend on the amount and location of excess skin to be removed as well as surgical judgment. 
  Advanced techniques usually allow incisions to be placed in strategic locations where they 
  can be hidden by most types of clothing and swimsuits.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  One common technique of complete lower body lift uses incisions similar to a bikini pattern to tighten the abdomen, 
  groin, waist, thighs and buttocks in one procedure. A circumferential incision around the body removes an apron 
  of excess skin and fat. Tissues are then repositioned and tightened.
</p>

<h3>Body Lift Recovery</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. 
  Following your physician's instructions is essential to the success of your 
  lower body lift and recovery. These instructions may include:
</p>
  <ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>How to care for your surgical site(s) following surgery.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing.</li>
   <li>Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site or in your general health.</li>
   <li>How to care for your drains.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
