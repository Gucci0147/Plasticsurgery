          <h3>Liposuction Candidates</h3>
          <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
            If you are bothered by excess deposits of fat that don't respond to diet or exercise located anywhere on your body, 
            liposuction may be right for you. Liposuction may be used to reduce localized fat deposits of the:
          </p>
          <ul className='fs-5'>
            <li>Thighs, hips and buttocks.</li>
            <li>Abdomen and waist.</li>
            <li>Upper arms.</li>
            <li>Back</li>
            <li>Chest area.</li>
            <li>Cheeks, chin and neck.</li>
            <li>Inner knee, calves and ankles.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
            Ideal candidates for liposuction are:
          </p>
          <ul className='fs-5'>
            <li>Adults within 30% of their ideal weight who have firm, elastic skin and good muscle tone.</li>
            <li>Healthy people who do not have a life-threatening illness or medical conditions that can impair healing.</li>
            <li>Non-smokers with a positive outlook and specific goals for body contouring.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
           Liposuction can be performed alone or along with other plastic surgery procedures, such as a Facelift, 
           Breast Reduction or Tummy Tuck.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
            Liposuction is not a treatment for obesity or a substitute for proper diet and exercise. 
            It is also not an effective treatment for cellulite (the dimpled skin that typically appears 
            on the thighs, hips and buttocks) or loose, saggy skin.
          </p>
            <h3>Your Liposuction Consultation</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              During your liposuction consultation, be prepared to discuss:
            </p>
            <ul className='fs-5'>
              <li>Your surgical goals.</li>
              <li>Medical conditions, drug allergies and medical treatments.</li>
              <li>Use of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</li>
              <li>Previous surgeries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              Your liposuction surgeon will also:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Evaluate your general health and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors.</li>
              <li>Take photographs.</li>
              <li>Discuss your body contouring options and recommend a course of treatment.</li>
              <li>Discuss the likely outcomes of liposuction and any risks or potential complications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Liposuction Risks and Safety Information</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>The decision to have liposuction surgery is extremely personal. You will have to decide if the benefits of liposuction 
              will achieve your goals and if the risks and potential complications are acceptable.
              </p>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                The risks of liposuction include:
              </p>
              <ul className='fs-5'>
                <li>Anesthesia risks.</li>
                <li>Bruising</li>
                <li>Change in skin sensation that may persist.</li>
                <li>Damage to deeper structures such as nerves, blood vessels, muscles, lungs and abdominal organs.</li>
                <li>Deep vein thrombosis, cardiac and pulmonary complications.</li>
                <li>Fluid accomolation</li>
                <li>Infection</li>
                <li>Irregular contours or asymmetries.</li>
                <li>Irregular pigmentation</li>
                <li>Need for revision surgery.</li>
                <li>Persistent swelling.</li>
                <li>Poor wound healing</li>
                <li>Rippling or loose skin, worsening of cellulite.</li>
                <li>Swelling</li>
                <li>Thermal burn or heat injury from ultrasound during ultrasound-assisted lipoplasty.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                These risks and others will be fully discussed prior to your consent. It is important that you 
                address all of your questions directly with your plastic surgeon. You will be asked to sign 
                consent forms to ensure that you fully understand the procedure and any risks and potential 
                complications.
              </p>
              <h3>Preparing for Liposuction</h3>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                In preparing for liposuction surgery, you may be asked to:
              </p>
              <ul className='fs-5'>
                <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
                <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
                <li>Stop smoking.</li>
                <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                Liposuction procedures are performed at our accredited Outpatient Surgery Facility in Birmingham, Alabama. 
                Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
              </p>
              <h3>Liposuction Procedure</h3>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                Anesthesia choices for liposuction surgery include local anesthesia, intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. 
                Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.
              </p>
              <h4>Liposuction Incisions</h4>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                Liposuction is performed through small, inconspicuous incisions.
              </p>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                First, diluted local anesthesia is infused to reduce bleeding and trauma. A thin hollow tube, or cannula, 
                is then inserted through the incisions to loosen excess fat using a controlled back and forth motion. 
                The dislodged fat is suctioned out of the body using a surgical vacuum or syringe attached to the cannula.
              </p>
              <h4>Laser and Ultrasound Assisted Liposuction</h4>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                Liposuction assisted with laser or ultrasound liquefies the fat before it is removed from the body.
              </p>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                <span className='fw-bold'>Laser Assisted Liposuction </span>focuses low-energy waves delivered by a thin laser fiber that 
                is inserted through small incisions. The laser energy is focused on the part of the body where you would 
                like to have a fatty pocket removed. After the fat is melted, a small cannula is used to suck out 
                the liquefied fat.
              </p>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              <span className='fw-bold'>Ultrasound Assisted Liposuction</span> uses a special cannula that vibrates very rapidly and gives off ultrasound energy. As the cannula passes through the fat cells, the ultrasonic waves liquefy the fat cells, which are then suctioned out. The ultrasound can be administered either above the skin (with a special emitter) or below the surface of the skin (with an ultrasound cannula).
              </p>
              
              <h3>Liposuction Recovery</h3>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your physician's instructions is key to the success 
                of your liposuction procedure. These instructions may include:
              </p>
              <ul className='fs-5'>
                <li>How to care for the surgical site and drains.</li>
                <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.</li>
                <li>Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site or in your general health.</li>
                <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                During your liposuction recovery, a compression garment or elastic bandages may cover treatment areas to help control swelling and compress 
                the skin to your new body contours. Small temporary drains may be placed in existing incisions beneath the skin to remove any excess blood or fluids.
              </p>
              <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
                It's important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, swelling, abrasion or motion during the time of healing.
              </p>
