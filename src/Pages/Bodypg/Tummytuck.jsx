      <p className="py-2 fs-5">
        People who have lost a considerable amount of weight, possibly following bariatric surgery, often experience excess abdominal 
        skin and laxity of the abdominal muscles. Even those of near-normal body weight and proportions to begin with can develop a protruding, 
        loose or sagging abdomen.
        </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            The causes of excess abdominal fat and skin include aging, heredity, pregnancy, prior surgery and significant 
            fluctuations in weight. Even though many of us strive for a flat and well-toned abdomen through exercise and 
            weight control, these methods sometimes fail to achieve our goals.
            </p>

            <h3>Tummy Tuck Prices</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              Tummy Tuck Cost: starts at $6,200 including facility fee
            </p>
            
            <h3>Tummy Tuck Candidates</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              In general, good candidates for a tummy tuck include:
            </p>
            <ul className='fs-5'>
              <li>People who are bothered by the appearance of their abdomen.</li>
              <li>Non-smokers who are physically healthy and at a stable weight.</li>
              <li>People who have realistic expectations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              Although the results of a tummy tuck are technically permanent, the positive outcome can be greatly diminished 
              by significant fluctuations in your weight. For this reason, people who are planning substantial weight loss 
              or women who may be considering future pregnancies would be advised to postpone a tummy tuck.
            </p>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              A tummy tuck cannot correct stretch marks, although they may be removed or somewhat improved if they are 
              located on the areas of excess skin that are excised.
            </p>

            <h3>Your Tummy Tuck Consultation</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              The success and safety of your tummy tuck depends very much on your complete candidness during your consultation. 
              You will be asked a number of questions about your health, desires and lifestyle. Be prepared to discuss:
            </p>
            <ul className='fs-5'>
            <li>Your surgical goals.</li>
            <li>Medical conditions, drug allergies and medical treatments.</li>
            <li>Use of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</li>
            <li>Previous surgeries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              Your tummy tuck surgeon will also:
            </p>
            <ul className='fs-5'>
              <li>Evaluate your general health and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors.</li>
              <li>Take photographs.</li>
              <li>Discuss your body contouring options and recommend a course of treatment.</li>
              <li>Discuss likely tummy tuck outcomes and any risks or potential complication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
             Be sure to ask questions at your consultation. It is very important to understand all aspects of your tummy tuck. 
             It's natural to feel some anxiety, whether preoperative stress or excitement about your anticipated new look. 
             Don't be shy about discussing these feelings with your plastic surgeon.
            </p>

            <h3>Tummy Tuck Risks and Safety Information</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              The decision to have abdominoplasty surgery is extremely personal. You will have to decide if the benefits 
              of a tummy tuck will achieve your goals and if the risks and potential complications are acceptable.
            </p>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              The risks of a tummy tuck include:
            </p>
            <ul className='fs-5'>
              <li>Anesthesia risks.</li>
              <li>Bleeding</li>
              <li>Infection</li>
              <li>Fluid accumulation (seroma).</li>
              <li>Poor wound healing</li>
              <li>Skin loss</li>
              <li>Numbness or other changes in skin sensation.</li>
              <li>Skin discoloration and/or prolonged swelling.</li>
              <li>Unfavorable scarring.</li>
              <li>Recurrent looseness of skin.</li>
              <li>Fatty tissue found deep in the skin might die (fat necrosis).</li>
              <li>Deep vein thrombosis, cardiac and pulmonary complications.</li>
              <li>Asymmetry.</li>
              <li>Suboptimal aesthetic result.</li>
              <li>Persistent pain.</li>
              <li>Possibility of revisional surgery.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              These risks and others will be fully discussed prior to your consent. It is important that you address all of your questions directly 
              with your plastic surgeon. You will be asked to sign consent forms to ensure that you fully understand the procedure and any risks.
            </p>

            <h3>Preparing for Tummy Tuck Surgery</h3>
            <ul className='fs-5'>
              <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
              <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
              <li>No smoking</li>
              <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              Your tummy tuck may be performed in an accredited office-based surgical facility, licensed ambulatory 
              surgical center or hospital. If performed as an outpatient procedure, be sure to arrange for someone 
              to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
            </p>

            <h3>Tummy Tuck Procedure</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              Anesthesia choices for abdominoplasty surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. 
              Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.
            </p>

            <h3>Tummy Tuck Insicions</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              The shape and length of the incision is determined by the amount of excess skin. Once the abdominal 
              skin is lifted, the underlying weakened abdominal muscles are repaired.
            </p>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              A second incision around the navel may be necessary to remove excess skin in the upper abdomen.
            </p>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              The upper abdominal skin is pulled down like a window shade. The excess skin is trimmed and the 
              remaining skin is sutured together. A new opening for the belly button is created. 
              The belly button is popped through to the surface and sutured into position.
            </p>

            <h3>Tummy Tuck Recovery</h3>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your 
              physician's instructions is essential to the success of your abdominoplasty and recovery. 
              These instructions may include:
            </p>
            <ul className='fs-5'>
              <li>How to care for the surgical site and drains.</li>
              <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.</li>
              <li>Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site or in your general health.</li>
              <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              During your tummy tuck recovery, dressings or bandages may be applied to your incisions and 
              you may be wrapped in an elastic bandage or compression garment to minimize swelling and 
              support your abdomen as it heals. Small, thin tubes may be temporarily placed under the 
              skin to drain any excess blood or fluids that may collect.
            </p>
            <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
              It's important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, swelling, 
              abrasion or motion during the time of healing.
