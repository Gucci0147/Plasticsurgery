      Gynecomastia is a condition of over-developed or enlarged breasts in men. This condition can occur at any age and often results 
      from hormonal changes, heredity, obesity or the use of certain drugs.
     </p>
     <p className="py-2 fs-5">
      Gynecomastia is characterized by excess localized fat, the development of excess glandular tissue and sometimes the presence
      of excess breast skin in one of both breasts. This condition can cause emotional discomfort and impair self-confidence. 
      Some men may even avoid certain physical activities and intimacy to hide their condition.

    </p>

    <h3>Male Breast Reduction Procedure</h3>
    <p className="py-2 fs-5">
      Anesthesia options for male breast reduction surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. 
      Your doctor will recommend the best option for you.

      <ul className="fs-5">

      <h3>Male Breast Reduction Recovery</h3>

        used to minimize swelling and support your new chest contour as it heals. A small, thin tube may be temporarily placed 
        under the skin to drain any excess blood or fluids that may collect.
