      <p className="py-2 fs-5">
        The breasts may begin to sag, droop or stretch as we age, losing their fullness and natural elasticity. 
        A Breast Lift, or Mastopexy, is an excellent solution to this effect of aging, gently restoring the 
        breasts to their natural, youthful state. A breast lift is often performed in conjunction with other 
        procedures, such as breast reduction or breast augmentation.
      </p>
      <p className="py-2 fs-5">
        During a breast lift, sagging breasts are raised and reshaped by carefully snipping away excess skin, 
        fat and tissue. The remaining skin is tightened and lifted. The areola and nipple are adjusted for the 
        most natural effect and the breasts are left to heal in their new position. Side effects include scarring, 
        bruising, swelling, general discomfort and loss of sensitivity in the breasts, but most disappear within a few weeks.
      </p>

      <h3>Breast Lift with Breast Augmentation</h3>
      <p className="py-2 fs-5">
        Breast Lift is an effective way to obtain a firmer, youthful-looking bustline, but when performed in conjunction 
        with Breast Augmentation results can be even more amazing. Trimming away excess fat, skin and tissue and lifting 
        the breasts allows for creation of a perfect "built-in bra." Doctors use this built-in bra to place the saline 
        or silicone breast implants in the most natural-looking position possible. The end result of this breast 
        enhancement procedure performed at our Alabama practice is full, shapely and perky breasts that look 
        completely natural.
      </p>

      <h3>Breast Lift Prices</h3>
          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
             Saline Breast Implants $2,500 <br/> 
             Silicone Breast Implants $3,500</p>

      <h3>Breast Lift Candidates</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">You may be a good candidate for a breast lift if:</p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>You are physically healthy and maintain a stable weight.</li>
          <li>You are bothered by the feeling that your breasts sag or have lost shape and volume.</li>
          <li>You don't smoke.</li>
          <li>Your breasts have a flatter, elongated shape or are pendulous.</li>
          <li>When unsupported, your nipples fall below the breast crease.</li>
          <li>Your nipples and areolas point downward.</li>
          <li>You have stretched skin and enlarged areolas.</li>
          <li>One breast is lower than the other.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Some women consider Breast Implants in addition to their breast lift. Implants can provide improved 
          upper breast fullness or cleavage. Implants can be placed at the same time as your breast lift or as 
          a second procedure.
        </p>
        <h3>Breast Lift and Pregnancy</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Breast surgery should be entertained only after child-bearing is completed. Changes that occur in the 
          breasts during pregnancy can minimize or reverse the improvement provided by a breast lift. 
          Significant weight loss after breast surgery can also negatively impact breast appearance.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Breast Lift Consultation</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          During your breast lift consultation, be prepared to discuss:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>Your surgical goals.</li>
          <li>Medical conditions, drug allergies and medical treatments.</li>
          <li>Use of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</li>
          <li>Previous surgeries.</li>
          <li>If you have a family history of breast cancer.</li>
          <li>The results of any mammograms or previous biopsies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="fs-5">
           Your breast lift surgeon may also:
        </p>
          <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Evaluate your general health and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors.</li>
              <li>Examine your breasts and take detailed measurements of their size and shape, skin quality and placement of your nipples and areolas.</li>
              <li>Take photographs.</li>
              <li>Discuss your breast enhancement options and recommend a course of treatment.</li>
              <li>Discuss the likely outcomes of breast lift surgery and any risks or potential complications.</li>
              <li>Discuss the use of anesthesia during your breast lift.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Be sure to ask questions at your consultation. It is very important to understand all aspects of your 
            breast lift. It's natural to feel some anxiety, whether preoperative stress or excitement about your 
            anticipated new look. Don't be shy about discussing these feelings with your plastic surgeon.
          </p>

          <h3>Breast Lift Risks and Safety Information</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The decision to have breast lift surgery is extremely personal. You will have to decide if the benefits 
          of a breast lift will achieve your goals and if the risks and potential complications are acceptable.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The risks of a breast lift include:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Anesthesia risks.</li>
            <li>Bleeding or hematoma formation.</li>
            <li>Infection.</li>
            <li>Poor healing of incisions.</li>
            <li>Changes in nipple or breast sensation, which may be temporary or permanent.</li>
            <li>Breast contour and shape irregularities.</li>
            <li>Breast asymmetry.</li>
            <li>Fatty tissue found deep in the skin might die (fat necrosis).</li>
            <li>Fluid accumulation.</li>
            <li>Potential partial or total loss of nipple and areola.</li>
            <li>Deep vein thrombosis, cardiac and pulmonary complications.</li>
            <li>Possibility of revisional surgery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          These risks and others will be fully discussed prior to your consent. It is important that you address 
          all of your questions directly with your plastic surgeon. You will be asked to sign consent forms to 
          ensure that you fully understand the procedure and any breast lift risks and potential complications.
        </p>

        <h3>Preparing for Breast Lift Surgery</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          In preparing for breast lift surgery, you may be asked to:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
            <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
            <li>Get a baseline mammogram before surgery and another one after surgery to help detect any future changes in your breast tissue.</li>
            <li>Stop smoking.</li>
            <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            A breast lift may be performed in an accredited office-based surgical center, outpatient or ambulatory surgical facility, 
            or hospital. Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
        </p>

        <h3>Breast Lift Procedure</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Your breast lift procedure can be achieved through a variety of incision patterns and techniques. 
          The appropriate technique for you will be determined based on:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>Breast size and shape.</li>
          <li>The size and position of your areolas.</li>
          <li>The degree of breast sagging.</li>
          <li>Skin quality and elasticity as well as the amount of extra skin.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Anesthesia choices for breast lift surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. 
          Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.
        </p>

        <h3>Breast Reshaping</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          After your doctor makes the incisions, the underlying breast tissue is lifted and reshaped to improve the 
          contour and firmness of the breasts. The nipple and areola are repositioned to a natural, more youthful height. 
          If necessary, enlarged areolas are reduced by excising skin at the perimeter. Excess breast skin is removed 
          to compensate for a loss of elasticity.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          After your breasts are reshaped and excess skin is removed, the remaining skin is tightened and the incisions 
          are closed. Sutures are layered deep within the breast tissue to create and support the newly-shaped breasts. 
          Sutures, skin adhesives and/or surgical tape may be used to close the skin.
        </p>

        <h3>Breast Lift Recovery</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your physician's instructions 
          is essential to the success of your breast lift and recovery. These instructions may include:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>How to care for your breasts following surgery.</li>
          <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.</li>
          <li>Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site or in your general health.</li>
          <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          After the procedure is completed, dressings or bandages will be applied to the incisions. A small, 
          thin tube may be temporarily placed under the skin to drain any excess blood or fluids that may collect.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          You will wear an elastic bandage or support bra to minimize swelling and support your breasts as they heal. 
          It is important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, swelling, abrasion or 
          motion during the time of healing.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Be sure to ask your plastic surgeon specific questions about what you can expect during your breast lift recovery period.
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>Where will I be taken after my surgery is complete?</li>
          <li>What medication will I be given or prescribed after surgery?</li>
          <li>Will I have dressings/bandages after surgery, and when will they be removed?</li>
          <li>Are stitches removed, and when?</li>
          <li>When can I resume normal activity and exercise?</li>
          <li>When do I return for follow-up care?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Breast Lift Results</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The results of your breast lift procedure with Doctors are immediately visible. The final, long-lasting 
          results will appear over the next few months as swelling resolves and breast shape and position continue 
          to settle. Satisfaction with your new image should continue to grow as you recover from surgery.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Some breast lift incision lines are concealed within the natural breast contours. However, others are visible 
          on the breast surface. Incision lines are permanent but will fade and significantly improve over time in most 
          cases. Your plastic surgeon will recommend the incisions which best suit your anatomy and will leave smallest 
          scar possible.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Over time, your breasts can continue to change due to aging and gravity. You will be able to retain your new 
          look longer if you maintain your weight and a healthy lifestyle.
        </p>
