           This can enhance your appearance with fuller breasts that have a natural look and feel. 
           Have you dreamed of having the full, shapely breasts that nature didn't give you? Breast augmentation is a safe, 
           increasingly common way to enhance your feminine curves and increase your level of self-confidence.
      </p>
      <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          During the breast augmentation procedure at CECM Plastic Surgery's cosmetic surgery center in San Diego, columbia, 
          an incision is made under the breast, around the nipple, above the belly button or under the arm. 
          Breast implants filled with saline at the time of surgery or pre-filled with silicone gel are gently 
          placed under or over the pectoralis muscle. The incision is then closed and left to heal.
      </p>
      <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Breast augmentation procedures performed by the Doctors take about 1 hour to complete. 
          Side effects typically include swelling, bruising, tenderness and a temporary decrease in nipple sensitivity, 
          but most subside within a few weeks.
      </p>

        Silicone Breast Implants $3,500</p>

        <h3>Breast Augmentation Candidates</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">You may be a candidate for breast augmentation if:</p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>You are physically healthy.</li>
          <li>You have realistic expectations.</li>
          <li>Your breasts are fully developed.</li>
          <li>You are bothered by the feeling that your breasts are too small.</li>
          <li>You are dissatisfied with your breasts losing shape and volume after pregnancy, after weight loss or with aging.</li>
          <li>You are unhappy with the upper part of your breast appearing "empty.".</li>
          <li>Your breasts are asymmetrical.</li>
          <li>One or both breasts failed to develop normally or have an elongated shape.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Breast Augmentation Consultation</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">During your consultation with our plastic surgeons, be prepared to discuss:</p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Why you want breast augmentation, your expectations and the desired outcome.</li>
            <li>Medical conditions, drug allergies and previous medical treatments.</li>
            <li>Use of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</li>
            <li>Family history of breast cancer and results of any mammograms or previous biopsies.</li>
        </ul>
      <p className="py-2 fs-5">Your breast augmentation surgeon will also:</p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Evaluate your general health and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors.</li>
            <li>Examine and measure your breasts, including detailed measurements of their size and shape, 
                skin quality and placement of your nipples and areolas.</li>
            <li>Take photographs.</li>
            <li>Discuss your breast enhancement options and recommend a course of treatment.</li>
            <li>Discuss the likely outcomes of breast augmentation and any risks or potential complications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Be sure to ask questions at your consultation. It is very important to understand all aspects of your breast augmentation procedure. 
          It's natural to feel some anxiety, whether preoperative stress or excitement about your anticipated new look. 
          Don't be shy about discussing these feelings with your plastic surgeon.
        </p>

        <h3>Breast Augmentation Risks and Safety Information</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The decision to have breast augmentation surgery is extremely personal.
           You will have to decide if the benefits of breast augmentation will achieve your goals 
           and if the risks and potential complications are acceptable.<br/>
        </p>
        <p className="">The possible risks breast augmentation include:</p>
        
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>Anesthesia risks.</li>
          <li>Bleeding.</li>
          <li>Infection.</li>
          <li>Changes in nipple or breast sensation.</li>
          <li>Poor scarring of skin.</li>
          <li>Wrong or faulty position of the implant.</li>
          <li>Implant leakage or rupture.</li>
          <li>Formation of tight scar tissue around the implant (capsular contracture).</li>
          <li>Fluid accumulation (seroma).</li>
          <li>Wrinkling of the skin over the implant.</li>
          <li>Pain, which may persist.</li>
          <li>Possibility of revisional surgery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparing for Breast Augmentation Surgery</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            In preparing for breast augmentation surgery, you may be asked to:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>Get a blood test.</li>
          <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
          <li>Stop smoking.</li>
          <li>Avoid taking aspirin and certain anti-inflammatory drugs, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Breast Augmentation Procedure</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Anesthesia choices for breast augmentation surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. 
          Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.
        </p>
        <h4>Breast Augmentation Incisions</h4>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Incisions vary based on the type of breast implant, degree of enlargement desired, 
          your particular anatomy and patient-surgeon preference. 
          The incisions are made in inconspicuous areas to minimize visible scarring. 
          You and your plastic surgeon will discuss the incision options that are appropriate 
          for your desired outcome. Incision options include:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>Inframammary Incision</li>
          <li>Periareolar Incision</li>
          <li>Transaxillary Incision</li>
          <li>Transumbilical Incision</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Breast Implant Insertion and Placement</h4>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          After the incision is made, a breast implant is inserted into a pocket either under the 
          pectoral muscle (submuscular placement) or directly behind the breast tissue, over the 
          pectoral muscle (submammary/subglandular placement).
        </p>
        <h4>Fat Transfer Breast Augmentation</h4>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Fat transfer breast augmentation uses Liposuction to take fat from other parts of the body and inject 
          it into the breasts. This is an option for women who are looking for a relatively small increase in 
          breast size and would prefer natural results. Your plastic surgeon may have you use a 
          Tissue Expansion system during the weeks before your surgery to improve results. 
          You may require touch-up injections to retain your improved shape. Certain risks are 
          associated with this breast augmentation technique.
        </p>
        <h4>Scarless Breast Augmentation</h4>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The Transaxillary and Transumbilical Breast Augmentation incisions do not leave scars in the breast area. 
          The transaxillary technique uses small incisions within the natural folds of the armpit, 
          while the transumbilical technique uses a small incision and at the upper rim of the belly button.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Breast Augmentation Recovery</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          After surgery, you will be taken into a recovery area to be closely monitored. 
          You may be permitted to go home after a few hours. Before leaving, you will be given specific instructions. 
          Be sure to carefully follow all instructions, which may include the following:
        </p>

        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>How to care for your breasts following surgery.</li>
          <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the risk of infection.</li>
          <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Your breasts will be wrapped in gauze dressings. An elastic bandage or support bra will minimize swelling 
          and support the breasts as they heal. You may be instructed to wear a support bra around the clock for 
          the first week or two. It is important to cleanse the incision sites and apply ointment as directed.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          After a post-surgical breast augmentation recovery period of 24 to 48 hours and an additional 
          reduced-activity period of a few days, you will likely experience soreness and swelling for a few weeks. 
          Exercise and normal activity can resume at the direction of your plastic surgeon.
        </p>
