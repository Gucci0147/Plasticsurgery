        Breast Reconstruction at CECM Plastic Surgery is achieved through several plastic surgery techniques that 
        attempt to restore a breast to near normal shape, appearance and size following a mastectomy. 
        Though the reconstructed breast will not function exactly like a natural breast, restoring your 
        feminine form and symmetry with breast reconstruction can have immense self-image, self-confidence
        and qualify of life benefits.
        </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            After you have faced the physical and emotional toll of breast cancer treatments and a mastectomy, the San Diego, Colombia  plastic surgeons at 
            CECM Plastic Surgery strive to make your breast reconstruction experience as positive as possible. Our goal is to use the latest 
            techniques to create a new breast and nipple that mirrors the size, shape and position of the natural breast as nearly as possible.
            </p>

            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              If only one breast is affected, it alone may be reconstructed. In addition, a Breast Lift, Breast Reduction or 
              Breast Augmentation may be recommended for the other breast to improve symmetry of the size and position of both breasts.
            </p>

            <h3>Breast Reconstruction Candidates</h3>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              Breast reconstruction is a good option for you if:
            </p>
            <ul className="fs-5">
              <li>You are able to cope well with your diagnosis and treatment.</li>
              <li>You do not have additional medical conditions or other illnesses that may impair healing.</li>
              <li>You have a positive outlook and realistic goals for restoring your breast and body image.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              Although breast reconstruction can rebuild your breast, the results are highly variable:
            </p>
            <ul className="fs-5">
              <li>A reconstructed breast will not have the same sensation and feel as the breast it replaces.</li>
              <li>Visible incision lines will always be present on the breast, whether from reconstruction or mastectomy.</li>
              <li>Certain surgical techniques will leave incision lines at the donor site, commonly located in less exposed areas of the body such as the back, abdomen or buttocks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              Breast reconstruction typically involves several procedures performed in multiple stages. It can begin 
              at the same time as mastectomy or be delayed until you heal from mastectomy and recover from any additional 
              cancer treatments.
            </p>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              It is important that you feel ready for the emotional adjustment involved in breast reconstruction. 
              It may take some time to accept the results. Breast reconstruction is a physically and emotionally 
              rewarding procedure for a woman who has lost a breast due to cancer or other condition.
            </p>

            <h3>Your Breast Reconstruction Consultation</h3>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              The success and safety of your breast reconstruction procedure depends very much on your complete candidness during your consultation. 
              Your surgeon will help you decide what is best for you. You will be asked a number of questions about your health, desires and lifestyle. 
              Be prepared to discuss:
            </p>
            <ul className="fs-5">
              <li>Why you want the surgery, your expectations and desired outcome.</li>
              <li>Medical conditions, drug allergies and medical treatments.</li>
              <li>Use of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</li>
              <li>Previous surgeries.</li>
              <li>The available breast reconstruction options.</li>
              <li>The likely outcomes of breast reconstruction and any risks or potential complications.</li>
              <li>The course of treatment recommended by your plastic surgeon, including procedures to achieve breast symmetry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              Your breast reconstruction surgeon may also:
            </p>
            <ul className="fs-5">
              <li>Evaluate your general health and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors.</li>
              <li>Examine your breasts and take detailed measurements of their size and shape, skin quality and placement of nipples and areolae.</li>
              <li>Take photographs for your medical record.</li>
              <li>Discuss your options and recommend a course of treatment.</li>
              <li>Discuss the likely outcomes of breast reconstruction and any risks or potential complications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Breast Reconstruction Risks and Safety Information</h3>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              Your plastic surgeon and/or staff will explain in detail the relevant risks associated with your specific surgery. 
              You may be asked to sign consent forms to ensure that you fully understand the procedures you will undergo and 
              any risks or potential complications. The decision to pursue breast reconstruction does not change your risk 
              of breast cancer recurrence.
            </p>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              The possible risks of breast reconstruction include, but are not limited to, bleeding, infection, poor healing 
              of incisions and anesthesia risks. You should also know that:
            </p>
            <ul className="fs-5">
                <li>Flap surgery includes the risk of partial or complete loss of the flap and a loss of sensation at both the donor and reconstruction site.</li>
                <li>The use of implants carries the risk of breast firmness (capsular contracture) and implant rupture.</li>
                <li>The development of a type of cancer of the immune system called breast implant- associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), primarily associated with textured implants.</li>
                <li>Breast implants may be associated with systemic symptoms commonly referred to as breast implant illness (BII), which can include fatigue, "brain fog," muscle or joint pain and rash.</li>
                <li>Acellular dermal matrix products may have a higher chance for complications or problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              You should feel free to ask any questions to help you understand the risks.
            </p>

            <h3>Breast Implant Safety</h3>
            <p className="py-2 fs-5">
              FDA-approved breast implants undergo extensive testing to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. 
              The vast majority of people with breast implants experience no serious complications. However, there are risks associated 
              with breast implants, including breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) and systemic symptoms 
              commonly referred to as breast implant illness (BII) that some patients attribute to their implants, which can include fatigue, 
              "brain fog," muscle or joint pain and rash. In the event any complication develops, patients should consult a board-certified 
              plastic surgeon to address it in a timely manner. Likewise, if a patient desires to have breast implants removed for any reason, 
              she should consult her plastic surgeon.
