        Excessively large breasts can make some women self-conscious. They also can be extremely 
        uncomfortable and inconvenient. When women with such curves do find bras that fit, 
        they are often left with indentations in their shoulders from the bra straps. 
        They also might have trouble finding clothing that flatters but doesn't accentuate, 
        and may experience discomfort during exercise and normal day-to-day activities.
      </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Breast Reduction surgery is a safe, permanent way to make the breasts smaller and more proportionate 
            to the body, ultimately increasing a patient's level of comfort and reducing her level of insecurity. 
            During the breast reduction procedure, unnecessary fat, tissue and skin are carefully extracted or 
            trimmed away and the remaining skin is positioned around the newly-shaped breast. 
            Side effects include general discomfort, inflammation, scarring, bruising and tenderness. 
            However, these side effects diminish as the breasts heal.

        <h3>Your Breast Reduction Consultation</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The success and safety of your breast reduction depends on your complete candidness during your consultation. 
          You will be asked a number of questions about your health, desires and lifestyle. Be prepared to discuss:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Why you want the surgery, your expectations and desired outcome.</li>
            <li>Medical conditions, drug allergies and medical treatments.</li>
            <li>Use of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</li>
            <li>Family history of breast cancer and results of any mammograms or previous biopsies.</li>
            <li>Previous surgeries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">Your breast reduction surgeon may also:</p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Evaluate your general health and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors.</li>
            <li>Examine your breasts and possibly take detailed measurements of their size and shape, 
              skin quality and placement of your nipples and areolas.</li>
            <li>Take photographs for your medical record.</li>
            <li>Discuss your breast enhancement options and recommend a course of treatment.</li>
            <li>Discuss the likely outcomes of your breast reduction procedure and any risks or potential complications.</li>
            <li>Discuss the use of anesthesia during your procedure for breast reduction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          At your consultation, it is very important to address all of your questions directly with your plastic surgeon. 
          It's natural to feel some anxiety prior to breast reduction, whether excitement for the anticipated outcome or 
          preoperative stress. Discuss these feelings with your plastic surgeon.
        </p>

        <h3>Breast Reduction Risks and Safety Information</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The decision to have breast reduction surgery is extremely personal. You will have to decide 
          if the benefits of breast reduction will achieve your goals and if the risks and potential complications 
          are acceptable.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The risks of breast reduction and breast reduction complications include:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Unfavorable scarring.</li>
            <li>Infection.</li>
            <li>Changes in nipple or breast sensation, which may be temporary or permanent.</li>
            <li>Anesthesia risks.</li>
            <li>Bleeding (hematoma).</li>
            <li>Blood clots.</li>

            <li>Breast asymmetry.</li>
            <li>Fluid accumulation.</li>
            <li>Excessive firmness of the breast.</li>
            <li>Potential inability to breastfeed.</li>
            <li>Potential loss of skin/tissue of breast where incisions meet each other.</li>
            <li>Potential, partial or total loss of nipple and areola.</li>
            <li>Deep vein thrombosis, cardiac and pulmonary complications.</li>
            <li>Pain, which may persist.</li>
            <li>Allergies to tape, suture materials and glues, blood products, topical preparations or injectable agents.</li>
            <li>Fatty tissue deep in the skin could die (fat necrosis).</li>
            <li>Possibility of revisional surgery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          You should know that:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Breast reduction can interfere with certain diagnostic procedures.</li>
            <li>Breast and nipple piercing can cause an infection.</li>
            <li>Your ability to breastfeed following breast reduction may be limited. Talk to your doctor if you are planning to nurse a baby.</li>
            <li>Breast reduction can be performed at any age, but is best done when the breasts are fully developed.</li>
            <li>Changes in the breasts during pregnancy and significant weight fluctuations can alter the outcomes of previous breast reduction surgery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Your plastic surgeon and/or plastic surgery staff will explain in detail the risks associated with surgery. 
          You will be asked to sign consent forms to ensure that you fully understand your breast reduction procedure 
          and the risks and potential complications.
        </p>

        <h3>Preparing for Breast Reduction</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          After researching the basics, many patients want to know what to expect before breast reduction surgery.
          Prior to surgery, you may be asked to:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
            <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
            <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
            <li>Get a baseline mammogram before surgery and another after surgery to help detect any future changes in your breast tissue.</li>
            <li>Stop smoking well in advance of breast reduction surgery.</li>
            <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Special instructions you receive will cover what to do on the day of surgery as well as post-operative care and follow-up
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Your plastic surgeon will discuss where your procedure will be performed. 
          Breast reduction may be performed in an accredited office-based surgical center, 
          outpatient/ambulatory surgical center or hospital. Your plastic surgeon and the 
          assisting staff will fully attend to your comfort and safety. 
          If your breast reduction is performed as an outpatient procedure, 
          be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and 
          stay with you the following night.
        </p>
        <h3>Breast Reduction Procedure</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Breast reduction surgery is usually performed through incisions on the breasts with surgical removal of 
            the excess fat, glandular tissue and skin.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            In some cases, excess fat may be removed through Liposuction in conjunction with the excision 
            techniques described below. If breast size is largely due to fatty tissue and excess skin is not 
            a factor, liposuction may be used alone.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            The technique used to reduce the size of your breasts will be determined by your individual condition, 
            breast composition, amount of reduction desired, your personal preferences and the surgeon's advice.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Anesthesia choices for breast reduction surgery include intravenous sedation and 
            general anesthesia. Your doctor will recommend the best choice for you.
        </p>

        <h4>Breast Reduction Incisions </h4>
        <p className="fs-5">
            Breast reduction incision options include:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>A circular pattern around the areola. The incision lines that remain are visible and permanent scars, 
              though usually well-concealed beneath a swimsuit or bra.</li>
          <li>A keyhole- or racquet-shaped pattern with an incision around the areola and vertically down to the breast crease.</li>
          <li>An inverted T- or anchor-shaped incision pattern.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Tissue Removal and Repositioning</h4>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          After the incision is made, the nipple (which remains tethered to its original blood and nerve supply) 
          is repositioned. The areola is reduced by excising skin at the perimeter, if necessary.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Underlying breast tissue is reduced, lifted and shaped. Occasionally, for extremely large pendulous breasts, 
            the nipple and areola may need to be removed and transplanted to a higher position on the breast 
            (free nipple graft).
        </p>
        <h4>Closing the Incisions</h4>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The incisions are brought together to reshape the now smaller breast. Sutures are layered deep within the 
          breast tissue to create and support the newly-shaped breasts. Sutures, skin adhesives and/or surgical tape 
          close the skin. Incision lines are permanent, but in most cases will fade and significantly improve over time.
        </p>

        <h3>Breast Reduction Recovery</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Following your physician's instructions is key to the success of your surgery and recovery. Your doctor will give 
          you specific instructions on how to care for yourself and minimize breast reduction surgery risks. These instructions may include:
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>How to care for your breasts following surgery.</li>
          <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the risk of infection.</li>
          <li>Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site or in your general health.</li>
          <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            When your breast reduction procedure is complete, dressings or bandages will be applied to the incisions. 
            An elastic bandage or support bra may be worn to minimize swelling and support the breasts as they heal. 
            A small, thin tube may be temporarily placed under the skin to drain any excess blood or fluids that may collect.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            After you go home, seek medical attention immediately if you experience shortness of breath, chest pains or 
            unusual heart beats. Should any of these complications occur, you may require hospitalization and additional 
            treatment.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            It's important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, abrasion or motion during the time 
            of healing.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Be sure to ask your plastic surgeon specific questions about what you can expect during your breast reduction recovery period.
        </p>
        <ul className="fs-5">
          <li>Where will I be taken after my surgery is complete?</li>
          <li>What medication will I be given or prescribed after surgery?</li>
          <li>Will I have dressings/bandages after surgery, and when will they be removed?</li>
          <li>Are stitches removed, and when?</li>
          <li>When can I resume normal activity and exercise?</li>
          <li>When do I return for follow-up care?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Breast Reduction Results</h3>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The results of your breast reduction surgery are immediately visible. Over time, post-surgical swelling will resolve 
          and incision lines will fade. Satisfaction with your new image should continue to grow as you recover.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            The results of breast reduction surgery will be long-lasting. Your new breast size should help relieve
            you from the pain and physical limitations experienced prior to breast reduction. 
            Your better-proportioned figure will likely enhance your self image and boost your self-confidence.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          Over time your breasts can change due to aging, weight fluctuations, hormonal factors and gravity.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 fs-5">
          The practice of medicine and surgery is not an exact science. Although good results are expected, there is no guarantee. 
          In some situations it may not be possible to achieve optimal results with a single breast reduction procedure and another 
          surgery may be necessary.
        </p>
