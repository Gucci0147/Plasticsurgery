<h3>What is a PDO Thread Lift?</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  The PDO Thread Lift, sometimes called a "lunchtime lift,", is a nonsurgical procedure used to lift and tighten facial skin to restore a younger look. 
  The threads are inserted into the skin using a tiny needle and then used to lift the skin upwards with little or no pain. Invisible beneath the skin, 
  the threads will safely dissolve over time.
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Besides the immediate lifting effect, the PDO threads stimulate the production of fresh, healthy collagen in the treated area. 
  Results will continue to improve during the next several months as the body's natural healing response works to improve the skin's tone, 
  firmness and elasticity.
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Thead Lifts are performed using only local anesthesia.
</p>

<h3>Who is a Good Candidate for the PDO Thread Lift?</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  The PDO Thread Lift is ideal for men and women seeking to address the early signs of aging. People with mild to moderate degrees of 
  skin laxity in the face and neck can see a tighter facial contour and a reduction in wrinkles and fine lines as the skin is gently 
  lifted into a more youthful position.
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Thread Lifts are much more affordable and have less recovery time than a surgical facelift, producing a more subtle, yet noticeable, lift.
</p>

<h3>What Areas Can be Treated?</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  PDO Threads are used to address sagging jowls, drooping cheeks, loose neck skin, brows, foreheads, the area around the eyes and more. 
  This minimally-invasive treatment in Birmingham, Alabama is particularly beneficial for the lower face and neck.
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  The PDO Thread Lift is often combined with Neurotoxins and Dermal Fillers to revitalize your appearance.
</p>

<h3>What Risks are Involved?</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  We will provide you with instructions on caring for yourself following your PDO Thread Lift. Mild swelling, bruising and soreness 
  are common as part of the natural healing process. These symptoms are usually brief and can be controlled with an over-the-counter 
  medication for mild pain and ice for minor swelling.
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  A brief downtime of 24 to 48 hours is usually necessary following a Thread Lift. After the procedure, patients are asked to:
</p>
<ul className="fs-5">
    <li>Avoid stenuous physical activity.</li>
    <li>Avoid sun exposure and protect your skin from the sun until healing is complete.</li>
    <li>Sleep on your back, and prop up your head to avoid rolling over onto your face.</li>
    <li>Keep to a minimum facial movements such as smiling, laughing and prolonged talking.</li>
    <li>Don't rub your face.</li>
    <li>Don't take blood-thinning medications (discontinue at least 3 days before the procedure).</li>
    <li>Avoid alcohol and smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid chewing gum.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Soon Will I See Results?</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  PDO Thread Lifts give you immediate results when the skin is pulled upwards to tighten the facial skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. 
  Your results will become even more apparent when swelling subsides and bruising, usually within a couple of days.
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  The support network created by the threads also induces the production of collagen, causing your results to continue to improve. 
  Results with the PDO Thread Lift can last up to 12 or more months.
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Because it carries so few risks and minimal downtime, patients may choose to repeat the procedure to maintain a 
  smoother, more youthful appearance that reveals their natural beauty.
