        Rhinoplasty, also known as Nose Surgery or Nose Reshaping, is designed to enhance facial harmony by 
        improving the nose's appearance and proportions, bringing it into better balance with the other facial features. 
        Rhinoplasty is also used to correct impaired breathing caused by structural defects of the nose.
        </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Rhinoplasty can change the width of the nose at the bridge and nose profiles with visible humps or depressions; correct nasal 
            tips that are enlarged or bulbous, drooping, upturned or hooked; and change the size and position of nostrils that are large, 
            wide or upturned. Nose surgery can also make the nose more symmetrical.
            </p>
        <h3>Rhinoplasty candidates</h3>
        <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
        You may be a good candidate for nose surgery if:
        </p>
        <ul className='fs-5'>
          <li>Your facial growth is complete.</li>
          <li>You are physically healthy.</li>
          <li>You don't smoke</li>
          <li>You have a positive outlook and realistic goals for improving your appearance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Rhinoplasty Consultation</h3>
        <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
        During your rhinoplasty consultation, be prepared to discuss:
        </p>
    <ul className='fs-5'>
      <li>Your surgical goals with regard to both appearance and breathing.</li>
      <li>Medical conditions, drug allergies and previous medical treatments.</li>
      <li>Use of current medications, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</li>
      <li>Previous surgeries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
    Your rhinoplasty surgeon may also:
    </p>
    <ul className='fs-5'>
        <li>Evaluate your general health and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors.</li>
        <li>Explain the available options for nose reshaping.</li>
        <li>Examine and measure your face.</li>
        <li>Take photographs.</li>
        <li>Discuss your options.</li>
        <li>Discuss the likely outcomes of arm lift surgery and any risks or potential complications.</li>
    </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Be sure to ask questions at your consultation. It is very important to understand all aspects of your Rhinoplasty. 
  It's natural to feel some anxiety, whether preoperative stress or excitement about your anticipated new look. 
  Don't be shy about discussing these feelings with your plastic surgeon.</p>
 
  <h3>Rhinoplasty Risks and Safety Information</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The decision to have nose surgery is extremely personal. You will have to decide if the benefits of rhinoplasty will
   achieve your goals and if the risks and potential complications are acceptable. Your plastic surgeon and/or staff 
   will explain the associated risks in detail.
  </p>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The risks of an Rhinoplasty include:
  </p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Anesthesia risks.</li>
    <li>Bleeding.</li>
    <li>Infection.</li>
    <li>Poor wound healing.</li>
    <li>Nasal septal perforation (a hole in the nasal septum) is rare. Additional surgical treatment may be 
        necessary to repair the septum, but it may be impossible to correct this complication.</li>
    <li>Difficulty breathing.</li>
    <li>Numbness or other changes in skin sensation.</li>
    <li>Unsatisfactory nasal appearance.</li>
    <li>Skin discoloration and swelling.</li>
    <li>Possible need for revisional surgery.</li>
    </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  These risks and others will be fully discussed prior to your consent. It is important that you address all of your 
  questions directly with your plastic surgeon. You will be asked to sign consent forms to ensure that you 
  fully understand the procedure.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for an Rhinoplasty</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  In preparing for nose surgery, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Nose surgery may be performed in an accredited office-based surgical facility, licensed ambulatory surgical center or hospital. 
  Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
</p>

<h3>Rhinoplasty Procedure</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Anesthesia choices for nose surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. Your doctor will 
  recommend the best choice for you.
</p>
<h5  className='fw-bold'>Nose Surgery Incisions</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Rhinoplasty is performed using either a closed procedure, where incisions are hidden inside the nose, or an open procedure, where an 
  incision is made across the columella (the narrow strip of tissue that separates the nostrils).
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Through these incisions, the skin that covers the nasal bones and cartilages is gently raised, allowing access to reshape the structure of the nose.
</p>
<h5  className='fw-bold'>Reshaping the Nose Structure</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  An overly large nose may be reduced in size by removing bone or cartilage. Nose surgery sometimes requires the addition of cartilage grafts, 
  most commonly using cartilage from the septum (the partition in the middle of the nose). Cartilage from the ear or, rarely, a section of rib cartilage 
  is occasionally used.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Once the underlying structure of the nose is sculpted to the desired shape, nasal skin and tissue is redraped and the incisions are closed. 
  Additional incisions may be placed in the natural creases of the nostrils to alter their size.
</p>
<h5  className='fw-bold'>Correcting a Deviated Septum</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  A deviated septum is one of the most common causes of breathing impairment. Nose surgery performed to improve an obstructed airway requires 
  careful evaluation of the nasal structure as it relates to airflow and breathing.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Correction of a deviated septum is achieved by adjusting the nasal structure to produce better alignment. The septum can be straightened 
  and the projections inside the nose can be reduced to improve breathing.
</p>

<h3>Rhinoplasty Recovery</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your physician's instructions is essential to the 
  success of your nose surgery and recovery. These instructions may include:
</p>
  <ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>How to care for the surgical site.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.</li>
   <li>Specific concerns to look for or in your general health.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
  </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  During initial healing, a splint and/or packing will likely be placed inside your nose and a splint or bandages placed on the outside to 
  support and protect the new structures. Initial swelling should subside within a few weeks.
