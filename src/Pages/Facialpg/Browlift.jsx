        As we age, unsightly wrinkle lines may appear on the forehead. Frown lines between the brows can make us 
        look angry or "too serious." Skin relaxation may cause the eyebrows to drop, hooding our upper eyelids 
        and making us look tired.
        </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            If you are bothered by these signs of aging in the brow region, a Brow Lift, or Forehead Lift, 
            may be right for you. This cosmetic surgery procedure reduces wrinkle lines that develop horizontally 
            across the forehead and at the top of the nose, improves frown lines (the vertical creases that develop 
            between the eyebrows), raises sagging brows that hood the upper eyelids and places the eyebrows in a 
            more alert and youthful position.

<h3>Preparing for an Browlift Surgery</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  In preparing for browlift surgery, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Browlift surgery may be performed in an accredited office-based surgical facility, licensed ambulatory surgical center or hospital. 
  Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
</p>

<h3>Browlift surgery Procedure</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  You will be given medication to keep you comfortable during surgery. Your surgeon will suggest either intravenous sedation or general anesthesia.
</p>
<h5  className='fw-bold'>Browlift surgery Incisions</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Brow lifts can be performed in different ways. Some surgeons prefer to use an endoscope (a thin tube with a camera on the end) and special instruments 
  placed through small incisions made within the hairline. This allows the tissue and muscle beneath the skin to be adjusted, correcting the source of 
  visible creases and furrows in the forehead.
</p>
<h6  className='fw-bold'>Endoscopic Brow Lift incision</h6>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Some surgeons prefer to perform a brow lift through a "coronal incision." This incision is created from ear to ear across the top of the head within 
  the hair-bearing skin.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The forehead skin is then lifted and any muscle adjustment can be made under direct visualization. The resulting scar is well-concealed within the hair.
</p>
<h6 className='fw-bold'>Coronal Brow Lift incision</h6>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  For women with very high foreheads, an incision just at the anterior hairline may be recommended. In this way, the brow can be lifted without altering the 
  height of the front hairline. The resulting scar, while somewhat more visible, can often be hidden with bangs.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Brow lift incisions are typically closed with removable or absorbable sutures, skin adhesives, surgical tape, special clips.
</p>

<h3>Browlift Surgery Recovery</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your physician's instructions is essential to the success of your brow lift and recovery. 
  These instructions that may include:
</p>
  <ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>How to care for the surgical site.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.</li>
   <li>Specific concerns to look for or in your general health.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
  </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  After the procedure, your forehead may be taped and your head may be loosely wrapped to minimize swelling and bruising. A thin tube may be present to drain 
  any excess blood or fluid that collects under the skin.<br/>

  Do not use ice or heat on the operated area. Keep your head elevated and avoid vigorous physical activity for as long as your surgeon recommends. 
  You should be ready to return to work and normal activity after 2 weeks.<br/>

  Initial wound healing may take 10 to 14 days. It is important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, swelling, abrasion or 
  motion during the time of healing. Sutures or clips will be removed when appropriate.
