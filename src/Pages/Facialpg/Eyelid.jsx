      <p className="py-2 fs-5">
        Eyelid Surgery, or Blepharoplasty, is a surgical procedure to improve the appearance of the upper eyelids, 
        lower eyelids or both. Whether you want to improve the appearance of your eyes or are experiencing functional 
        problems with your eyelids, eyelid surgery can rejuvenate your face with a brighter look.
        </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Eyelid surgery can treat loose or sagging skin that creates folds or disturbs the natural contour of the upper eyelid, 
            sometimes impairing vision, as well as excess fatty deposits that appear as eyelid puffiness. Blepharoplasty is also 
            used to address bags under the eyes, drooping lower eyelids that reveal white below the iris, and excess skin 
            and fine wrinkles of the lower eyelids.
            </p>

  fully understand the procedure.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for an Eyelid Surgery</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  In preparing for eyelid surgery, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Eyelid surgery may be performed in an accredited office-based surgical facility, licensed ambulatory surgical center or hospital. 
  Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
</p>

<h3>Eyelid surgery Procedure</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Anesthesia choices for eyelid surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. Your doctor will 
  recommend the best choice for you.
</p>
<h5  className='fw-bold'>Eyelid surgery Incisions</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The incision lines for eyelid surgery are designed so that the resultant scars will be well-concealed within the natural structures of the eyelid region.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The upper eyelid can be corrected through an incision within the natural crease of the eyelid. This allows for removal or repositioning of fat deposits, 
  tightening of muscles and removal of excess skin.
</p>
<h6  className='fw-bold'>Upper Eyelid Surgery incision</h6>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Conditions of the lower eyelid may be corrected with an incision just below the lower lash line. Through this incision, excess skin in the lower eyelid is removed. 
  Again, the excess fat can be repositioned or removed.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  A transconjunctival incision, created on the inside of the lower eyelid, is an alternate technique to correct lower eyelid conditions and redistribute or remove excess fat. 
  No skin is removed with this technique.
</p>
<h6 className='fw-bold'>Lower Eyelid Surgery incision</h6>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Eyelid incisions are typically closed with removable sutures, skin adhesives, surgical tape.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your surgeon may suggest the use of a Laser or Chemical Peel to reduce discoloration of the lower eyelids.
</p>

<h3>Eyelid Surgery Recovery</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your physician's instructions is essential to the 
  success of your nose surgery and recovery. These instructions may include:
</p>
  <ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>How to care for the surgical site.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.</li>
   <li>Specific concerns to look for or in your general health.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
  </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  After your procedure, lubricating ointment and cold compresses may be applied. In some cases your eyes may be loosely covered with gauze.<br/>

  Initial healing may include some swelling, bruising, irritation or dry eyes. Discomfort can be controlled with medication, cold compresses 
  and ointment. Irritation at the incision sites is also possible.<br/>

  It's important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, abrasion or motion during the time of healing.
