         Ears that are overly large or "stick out" from the sides of the head can have a detrimental effect on the 
        self-esteem of both children and adults. People may also have ears with deformities in shape caused by injuries or birth defects. Any of these problems can cause an undesirable imbalance of the facial features and have a profound effect on a person's appearance and self-confidence.

        During a breast lift, sagging breasts are raised and reshaped by carefully snipping away excess skin, 
        fat and tissue. The remaining skin is tightened and lifted. The areola and nipple are adjusted for the 
        most natural effect and the breasts are left to heal in their new position. Side effects include scarring, 
        bruising, swelling, general discomfort and loss of sensitivity in the breasts, but most disappear within a few weeks.

<h3>Your Ear Surgery Consultation</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  The success and safety of your ear surgery depends very much on your complete candidness during your consultation. 
  You will be asked a number of questions about your health, desires and lifestyle. Be prepared to discuss:
</p>
<ul className="fs-5">
    <li>Why you want the procedure, your expectations and desired outcome.</li>

</p>

  <h3>Ear Surgery Risks and Safety Information</h3>

</p>

<h3>Preparing for Ear Surgery</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Prior to ear surgery, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className="fs-5">
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking well in advance of surgery.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin and certain anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  You will receive special instructions that cover:
</p>
<ul className="fs-5">
    <li>What to do on the day of surgery.</li>
    <li>The use of anesthesia during your procedure.</li>
    <li>Post-operative care and follow-up.</li>
</ul>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Ear surgery may be performed in an accredited office-based surgical facility, ambulatory surgical facility or hospital. 
  If performed as an outpatient procedure, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home after surgery and stay with 
  you for at least the ?rst night.
</p>

<h3>Ear Surgery Procedure</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Correction of protruding ears uses surgical techniques to create or increase the antihelical fold (just inside the rim of the ear) 
  and to reduce enlarged conchal cartilage (the largest and deepest concavity of the external ear).
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Anesthesia choices for ear surgery include local, intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. Your doctor will recommend 
  the best choice for you.
</p>
<h4>Ear Surgery Incisions</h4>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Incisions for otoplasty are generally made on the back surface of the ear. When incisions are necessary on the front of the ear, 
  they are made within its folds to hide them. Internal, non-removable sutures are used to create and secure the newly-shaped cartilage in place.
</p>      

<h3>Ear Surgery Recovery</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Your doctor will give you speci?c instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your plastic surgeon's instructions is key to the success 
  of your ear surgery. These instructions may include:
</p>
<ul className="fs-5">
    <li>How to take care of your ears following surgery.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the risk of infection.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
</ul>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  After surgery, bandages or dressings will be applied to keep your surgical site clean, protect it from trauma and support the new position of 
  the ear during initial healing.
