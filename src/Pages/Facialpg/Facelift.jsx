        As we age, many people see sagging in the middle of the face as well as deep creases below the lower eyelids and along 
        the nose to the corner of the mouth. Fat may fall or disappear, loss of skin tone in the lower face can create jowls, 
        and loose skin and excess fatty deposits under the chin and jaw can give the appearance of a double chin, even for a 
        person of normal weight.

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            A Facelift, or Rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure that improves visible signs of aging in the face and neck. 
            If the appearance of your face doesn't properly reflect your youthful outlook on life, a facelift at Plastic Surgery 
            can give you a firmer facial appearance with natural results.

</p>

<h3>Preparing for an Facelift</h3>

<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  In preparing for facelift surgery, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className='fs-5'>
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Arm lifts are performed at our accredited Outpatient Surgery Facility, 
  Be sure to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
</p>

<h3>Facelift Procedure</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Anesthesia choices for facelift surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. Your doctor 
  will recommend the best choice for you.
</p>
<h5  className='fw-bold'>Facelift Incisions</h5>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Depending on the degree of change you would like to see, your facelift choices include a traditional facelift, 
  a limited incision facelift or a neck lift.
</p>
<h6 className="fw-bold">Traditional Facelift</h6>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  A traditional facelift incision often begins in the hairline at the temples, continues around the ear and ends 
  in the lower scalp. Fat may be sculpted or redistributed from the face, jowls and neck. The underlying tissue is 
  repositioned and the deeper layers of the face and the muscles are commonly lifted. Skin is redraped over the 
  uplifted contours and excess skin is trimmed away.
</p>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  A second incision under the chin may be necessary to further improve an aging neck. The incisions are closed with 
  sutures or skin adhesives.
</p>   
<h6 className="fw-bold">Limited Incision Facelift</h6>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  An alternative to a traditional facelift uses shorter incisions at the temples, continuing around the ear and possibly 
  within the lower eyelids or under the upper lip.
</p>
<h6 className="fw-bold">Neck Lift Incisions</h6>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Sagging jowls, loose neck skin and fat accumulation under the chin may be corrected with a Neck Lift. The neck lift incision 
  often begins in front of the ear lobe and wraps around behind the ear ending in the lower scalp.
</p>
<h6 className="fw-bold">Endoscopic Subperiosteal Facelift</h6>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  The incisions for an endoscopic subperiosteal facelift are placed inconspicuously in your mouth and temple. 
  During the procedure, the fat pads of your cheeks are repositioned up and over the cheekbones where they belong. 
  This redraping improves the nasal furrows caused by drooping fat pads. An endoscopic subperiosteal facelift is 
  frequently performed in conjunction with Eyelid Surgery or a Brow Lift for optimal results.
</p>

<h3>Facelift Recovery</h3>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your physician's 
  instructions is essential to the success of your arm lift and recovery. These instructions may include:
</p>
  <ul className='fs-5'>
    <li> How to care for the surgical site and drains.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.</li>
    <li>Specific concerns to look for.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
  </ul>
<p className='py-2 fs-5'>
  After your procedure, a bandage may be placed around your face to minimize swelling and bruising. 
  Thin tubes may be present to drain any excess blood or fluids that collects under the skin.
</p>
  <p className='py-2 fs-5'>
    It's important that the surgical incisions are not subjected to excessive force, abrasion or 
    motion during the time of healing. Avoid wearing any clothing that must go over your head.
