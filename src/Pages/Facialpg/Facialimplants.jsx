        If you are bothered by a small chin, weak jaw or lack of facial contour, you may be a candidate for plastic surgery with Facial Implants.
        </p>

          <p className="py-2 fs-5">
            Made of specially formed solid materials that are compatible with human tissues, facial implants bring balance and better proportion 
            to the structural appearance of the face. While any area of the face can be enhanced or augmented with implants, the most common sites 
            for facial implants are the cheeks, chin, jaw and nose.
            </p>
            <ul className="fs-5">
              <li>Chin Implants can increase the size and projection of a chin that is not in proportion with the forehead and mid-face.</li>
              <li>Jaw Implants increase the width of the lower third of your face.</li>
              <li>Cheek Implants increase the projection of the cheekbones, adding volume to areas that may be recessed or flat.</li>
              <li>Nasal Implants are used to clear obstructions, enhance the shape of the nose, correct malformed areas and improve facial symmetry.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Facial Implants candidates</h3>
        <p className='py-2 fs-5'>

</p>

<h3>Preparing for Facial Implants</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  In preparing for facial implants, you may be asked to:
</p>
<ul className="fs-5">
    <li>Get lab testing or a medical evaluation.</li>
    <li>Take certain medications or adjust your current medications.</li>
    <li>Stop smoking.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, as they can increase bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Facial implant surgery may be performed in an accredited office-based surgical facility, licensed ambulatory 
  surgical center or hospital. If performed as an outpatient procedure, be sure to arrange for someone to drive 
  you to and from surgery and stay with you for at least the first night.
  </p>

  <h3>Facial Implants Procedure</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Anesthesia options for facial implant surgery include intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. Your doctor will recommend the best option for you.
</p>  
  <h4>Cheek Implants</h4>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  The specific area to be augmented in the cheek determines where an implant will be positioned on the cheekbone. Cheek implants are most often placed through incisions in the mouth. When performed with other procedures, alternate incisions may be recommended, including placement through an incision inside the lower eyelid or within the hairline.
</p>
  <h4>Chin Implants</h4>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  The incision for chin implants may be inside your mouth along the crease that joins your lower lip and gums. 
  An alternative is an incision just beneath the chin.
</p>
  <h4>Jaw Implants</h4>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Jaw implants are generally placed through the mouth with incisions inside the mouth, back along the jawline at 
  the crease where the inside of your cheek and gums meet. Your incisions will be closed with absorbable sutures 
  or stitches that will be removed within 1 to 2 weeks.
</p>
  <h4>Nasal Implants</h4>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Nasal implants are carefully inserted into a small pocket along the bridge of the nose, the base of the nose 
  or both. Incisions may be made inside one or both nostrils. Once your plastic surgeon adjusts the implant for 
  a proper fit, he or she will close the incision with self-dissolving sutures. Stabilizing tape and a nasal 
  splint are usually applied to keep the implant in position as it heals.
</p>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  This form of Nose Surgery sometimes involves altering or reshaping cartilage and bone to change the profile 
  of the nose. However, the desired results are often seen by adjusting the size of the implant.
</p>

  <h3>Facial Implants Recovery</h3>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for yourself. Following your physician's instructions 
  is essential to the success of your facial implant surgery and recovery. These instructions may include:
</p>
<ul className="fs-5">
    <li>How to care for the surgical site.</li>
    <li>Medications to apply or take orally to aid healing and reduce the potential for infection.</li>
    <li>Specific concerns to look for at the surgical site or in your general health.</li>
    <li>When to follow-up with your plastic surgeon.</li>
</ul>
<p className="py-2 fs-5">
  Once your facial implants procedure is completed, bandages or dressings may be applied to keep the surgical site 
  clean and support the position of the implant during initial healing.
